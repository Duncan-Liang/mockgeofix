building/hacking/...
====================

Checkout this repo in Android studio, wait for gradle sync to finish
(you might need to install missing android-21 target) and click "build" :)

Just click "Run" and choose a running device (requires "USB debugging" enabled)..  

Alternatively, you can use "Build/Build APK" to build an unsigned APK (you can copy and 
install this APK on your phone (requires allowed "Unknown sources").
